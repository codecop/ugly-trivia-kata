ugly-trivia-kata
================

Remote pair-programming code kata by [Thomas Sundberg](https://thomassundberg.wordpress.com/)
and [Peter Kofler](http://www.code-cop.org/): working on
[Ugly Trivia code base from J.B. Rainsberger](https://github.com/jbrains/trivia).

## Learnings ##

We did the kata for 15 or 16 sessions, around 40 hours of testing and refactoring.

### Sessions ###
* Long running exercise, almost two years.
* In between long time no session.
* ONCE A MONTH SHOULD BE GOOD.

### Interest ###
* After approx. 12 sessions, we lost it.
* Hard to get started, we had a philosophical discussion about why we are doing this exercise
* but hard to stop when you are in the middle of something.
* boring? maybe but would like to see the final outcome

### Getting into the code after some time ###
* TODOs are valuable for getting started next time.

### Fixing Implementation ###
* Maybe the tests are too connected to the implementation.
* we could not change because the tests fixed the functionality of the methods (not the implementation).
* So maybe we should not have added tests for API if we might change it later.
* maybe staying with Golden Master gives us freedom to change more.
* Idea: stay with golden master much longer until API emerges.
* A golden master would be much better until public API is stable.

### Open Issues ###
* feature envy to player, fix will break tests - so reluctant to do it
* restructure methods to be either high or low level so we can see the algorithm - maybe done?
