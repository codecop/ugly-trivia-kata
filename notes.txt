* Hard to get started, we had a philosophical discussion about why we are doing this exercise
* we are less enthusiastic than usual, maybe we need sth new
* could we do this exercise smarter? going other ways, not redoing things and tests.
  maybe staying with Golden Master gives us freedom to change more.
* Idea: stay with golden master much longer until API emerges.
* Maybe the tests are too connected to the implementation.
  So if not, then Game would be the API and all tests (unit) would go through the API and not be coupled to the implementation.
* Idea: Create exactly this app TDD or BDD style up front and verify against Golden Master?

Rethink: Why did we start this?
* we brought it sort of under test, we could go further for some classes, but it be more of the same.
* we experimented with capturing system out
* we have no idea why we started it
* we had a lot of fun

* we were both tired, but even then we did 2 Pomodoros.
* hard to stop when you are in the middle of something
* Started with planning for next session
* TODOs are valuable for getting started
* boring? maybe but would like to see the final outcome

* long time no session
* once a month should be good
* when all TODOs are done we should have a prio list for next time (or red test)
  (but when refactoring we usually do not have red tests)

Ideas what to do next:
* fix TODOs
* look at coverage, look at PIT coverage - can we improve tests
* use Texttest as another experiment Golden Master experiment
  (as branch from the original code and then move forward and see if we broke stuff)
  similar to branch "exercise-golden-master" - see where it starts and create a similar one up front, then merge into head when it is finished
