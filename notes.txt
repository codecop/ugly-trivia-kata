* we were both tired, but even then we did 2 Pomodoros.
* hard to stop when you are in the middle of something
* Started with planning for next session
* TODOs are valuable for getting started
* boring? maybe but would like to see the final outcome

* long time no session
* once a month should be good
* when all TODOs are done we should have a prio list for next time (or red test)
  (but when refactoring we usually do not have red tests)

Ideas what to do next:
* fix TODOs
* look at coverage, look at PIT coverage - can we improve tests
* use Texttest as another experiment Golden Master experimentn 
  (as branch from the original code and then move forward and see if we broke stuff)
  similar to branch "exercise-golden-master" - see where it starts and create a similar one up front, then merge into head when it is finished
